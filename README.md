# OCP7_algorithms-tryouts

Repo only used for educational purposes.</br>

Not to be seen as a project but rather as a safe place to try and make algorithms in Python.</br>
In this idea, the different .py files are not necessarily linked to each other.*

Data needed, exception or missing not handled.

*For now all related to an adaptation of the 0-1 knapsack problem for an exercise.*


\* *optimized.py* needed for *backtest.py*
